# Plan: Document Time-based Rotation Features

**Objective:** Add comprehensive documentation for time-based rotation (daily pattern) to README.md

**Context from previous plans:**
- Plans 03-01 through 03-04 implemented time-based rotation infrastructure
- Daily rotation pattern supported via `rotation: { pattern: 'daily' }` configuration
- Hybrid rotation supported (pattern + maxSize combination)
- Date-stamped filenames follow UTC timezone
- All functionality tested and verified (165 tests passing)

## Tasks

1. [type="auto"] Add time-based rotation section to README.md
   - Add new subsection after "Size Format" in Log Rotation section
   - Document daily pattern configuration
   - Provide code examples
   - Explain UTC timezone behavior
   - Document hybrid rotation (pattern + maxSize)

2. [type="auto"] Update RotationConfig table in API section
   - Add `pattern` field to configuration options table
   - Document valid values ('daily')
   - Note backward compatibility (optional field)

3. [type="auto"] Add migration guide for time-based rotation
   - Show how to add daily rotation to existing size-based config
   - Demonstrate hybrid rotation setup
   - Provide before/after examples

## Success Criteria

- [ ] README.md includes time-based rotation documentation
- [ ] Daily pattern configuration documented with examples
- [ ] Hybrid rotation (pattern + maxSize) explained
- [ ] API Configuration Options table includes pattern field
- [ ] Migration guide shows time-based rotation adoption path
- [ ] Documentation is clear and follows existing README style

## Verification

Read README.md and verify:
- Time-based rotation section exists
- Code examples are valid TypeScript
- API table includes pattern field with valid values
- Migration examples are practical and clear

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tasks executed
- [ ] Each task committed individually
- [ ] SUMMARY.md created
- [ ] STATE.md updated

## Output Specification

**Files modified:**
- README.md (add time-based rotation documentation)

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive time-based rotation documentation
- API table updated with pattern field
- Migration guide for adopting daily rotation
