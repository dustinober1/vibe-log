# Milestone v1.0: Transport System

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-1
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Add transport abstraction and file logging to enable logs to be written to files and custom destinations. This milestone delivers a clean, extensible transport system while maintaining log-vibe's zero-dependency philosophy and beautiful aesthetic.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Transport System

**Goal**: Add transport abstraction and file logging to enable logs to be written to files and custom destinations.
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Create transport interface and extend types
- [x] 01-02: Implement FileTransport and ConsoleTransport
- [x] 01-03: Integrate transports into logger and config
- [x] 01-04: Write tests and documentation

**Details:**

**Execution Waves:**

**Wave 1 (Foundational):**
- Plan 01-01: Transport interface, type definitions, public API

**Wave 2 (Implementation):**
- Plan 01-02: FileTransport and ConsoleTransport implementations

**Wave 3 (Integration):**
- Plan 01-03: Wire transports into logger and configuration

**Wave 4 (Validation):**
- Plan 01-04: Comprehensive tests and documentation

**Key Deliverables:**
- ✅ Transport interface with `log()` and optional `close()` methods
- ✅ FileTransport using Node.js streams
- ✅ ConsoleTransport for backward compatibility
- ✅ `configure({ file: './app.log' })` shorthand
- ✅ Multiple transports support
- ✅ Custom transport API
- ✅ 97.24% test coverage
- ✅ Complete documentation

**Out of Scope:**
- ❌ Log rotation (deferred to v1.1)
- ❌ Remote service transports (users can build via custom API)
- ❌ Built-in compression (deferred to v1.1)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
None

**Key Decisions:**

- Synchronous `log()` method — Logging must not block; async handled internally
- Both formatted string AND raw entry — Enables simple and advanced use cases
- Stream-based FileTransport — Node.js built-in, no dependencies
- File shorthand `{ file: './app.log' }` — Simple configuration for common case
- Optional `close()` method — Transports without resources don't need stubs
- Transport errors caught in try-catch — Prevent transport failures from crashing app
- Forward reference for Transport type — Avoids circular dependency
- Default ConsoleTransport on module load — Backward compatibility
- `configure()` returns `LoggerConfig` — File/transports/console are optional

**Issues Resolved:**

- Type system compatibility with optional config fields (InternalConfig type)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance for unused parameters
- Transport interface signature mismatch
- Stream error handling to prevent crashes

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — All code is clean, tested, and documented.
